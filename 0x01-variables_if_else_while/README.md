# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

###### This directory contains c task files for my alx project **0x01-variables_if_else_while**. The project was centered around learning about variables, if, if_else statements and loop statements such as while, for and do while loops.

**Prerequisite**

To run the program compile the c file using ***gcc***.

**Usage**

Ex. `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-positive_or_negative.c -o 0-positive_or_negative`

**Files**

- `0-positive_or_negative.c` : The program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
- `1-last_digit.c` : This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
- `2-print_alphabet.c` : A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `3-print_alphabets.c` : A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- `4-print_alphabt.c` : A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `5-print_numbers.c` : A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- `6-print_numberz.c` : A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c` : A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
- `8-print_base16.c` : A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `9-print_comb.c` : A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- `100-print_comb3.c` : A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- `101-print_comb4.c` : A program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
- `102-print_comb5.c` : A program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
