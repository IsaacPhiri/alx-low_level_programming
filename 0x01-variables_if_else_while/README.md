# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

###### This directory contains c task files for my alx project **0x01-variables_if_else_while**. The project was centered around learning about variables, if, if_else statements and loop statements such as while, for and do while loops.

**Prerequisite**

To run the program compile the c file using ***gcc***.

**Usage**

Ex. `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-positive_or_negative.c -o 0-positive_or_negative`

**Files**

- `0-positive_or_negative.c` : The program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
