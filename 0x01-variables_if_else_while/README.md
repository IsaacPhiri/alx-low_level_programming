# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This directory contains c task files for my alx project **0x01-variables_if_else_while**. The project was centered around learing about variables and if, if_else and loop statements such as the forloop.

- `0-positive_or_negative` : The program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
