# 0x00-hello_world

###### This directory contains task files for my alx project **0x00-hello_world**. The project was centered around learning the process of Compilation and how to write a C program that prints to std i/o.

**Prerequisite**

- To run the programs compile the c files using ***gcc***, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

**Usage**

- Running scripts, Ex. Create and export a C file `julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ export CFILE=main.c` then run the executable `julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ ./0-preprocessor `
- Compiling C files, Ex. `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 4-puts.c`

**Files**

- `0-preprocessor` : a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
- `1-compiler` : a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- `2-assembler` : a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
- `3-name` : a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
- `4-puts.c` : a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
- `5-printf.c` : a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
- `6-size.c` : a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- `100-intel` : a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
- `101-quote.c` : a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
